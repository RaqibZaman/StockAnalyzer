# StockAnalyzer
A Stock Analysis Project for Making Informed Decisions
---
This is a new project I am taking on in my free time to practice and further develop my python skills. Here is my brief outline for this coding project:
1. Develop a GUI using pyqt
2. Develop the backend
3. Use APIs to collect data about different stocks and display them in teh app
4. Further process data on different stocks and interpret whether it is a good time to buy or sell a stocks
5. Have a newfeed populate on the side, which will provide buying or selling signals for each stock.
